# RxjsPractice

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 14.2.4.

The main purpose of this project is to add practice examples for rxjs. 

I will also have some git uses that I've not practiced a lot, or properly so far in my career.

## Covered Topics

This list wil be updated continuously as I develop further features in it using rxjs. According to [Learn RXJS](https://www.learnrxjs.io/learn-rxjs/operators), there are 98 operators in RxJs, and we'll try to cover every single one.

## Testing

The goal is to utilize rxjs' all features to make sure the understanding of the developer is matured. The test will also be updated, with complete documentation on how to execute tests of a certain operator.

## Backend

We will be using [JSON Placeholder](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/) API to test out

## Project Structure

This will contain a side bar, which will be populated as we go.

Main page will consist of a list view (table), with an add button, delete button, and so on.

We will incorporate polling to fetch updated list every 1 minute as well.
