    <p class="mb-4">This list will be updated continuously as I develop further features in it using RxJS. According
        to <a href="https://www.learnrxjs.io/learn-rxjs/operators" class="text-blue-500 hover:underline">Learn
            RXJS</a>, there are 98 operators in RxJs, and we'll try to cover every single one.</p>

            <ul class="list-disc list-inside mb-4">
                <li>Instead of using HttpClient, I used Rxjs Ajax (which I'm sure Angular uses too, but you never
                    know :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:)</li>

            <ul class="list-disc list-inside mb-4">
                <li>Mapped response to filter out the junk data coming from ajax call</li>
                <li>So far, as per my research, we cannot use map and filter (rxjs) one together as both get a
                    similar array. Filter does not get a singular object one by one as expected. So we can filter
                    elements in map. Will continue updating it as we go.</li>

                <li>Successfully converted array of objects into an observable, piped it, and subscribed it. It is

                <li>Extended operator for reduce in arrays and streams, but reduce only provides the final

                <li>It has an accumulated and current value, and we can process that as we go. Pretty neat.</li>

                <li>To understand share, you need to know about multicast and refCount (explained below, don't worry

                        <li>A mechanism to introduce a Subject into the observable stream.</li>
                        <li>This allows sharing a single subscription to the underlying stream between multiple
                            subscribers.</li>
                        <li>Basically, casting values in multiple observables at once. Wow üòç but I still don't get
                            it üòê</li>
                        <li>To understand multicast properly, I dived into this link</li>
                        <li><strong>My Explanation:</strong></li>
                        <ul class="list-disc list-inside mb-2">
                            <li>When we need to subscribe twice to an observable (depends on the use case, tbh), add
                                multicast pipe with new Subject() as return.</li>
                            <li>Side note: You will need to typecast as ConnectableObservable where type can
                                    be anything you want depending on the expected response.</li>
                            <li>This will do nothing yet, as there is the final link called connect. To do this, you
                                will need to simply do obs.connect and this will trigger a new magic.</li>
                            <li>Once all these steps are done, you will be able to observe that there is only one
                                response observed of maybe a thousand subscriptions made by our dear observable.
                            </li>
                            <li>Alas, all of this is deprecated now. Use share now üòú</li>

                <ul class="list-disc list-inside mb-2">
                    <li>As long as there is at least one subscriber to our dear shared observable, this operator
                        keeps an active subscription to the source observable. When all subscribers have
                        unsubscribed, it will stop the active subscription too. Get it? No? I didn't too, baby üòò
                    </li>
                    <li>See when we use refCount, we don't need to explicitly use <strong>connect</strong> in a
                        <strong>ConnectableObservable</strong></li>
                </ul>
                <li>Basically, share manages everything multicast did plus refCount, but internally, so you don't
                    have to worry about weird terms like refCount, connect, ConnectableObservable, etc.</li>

                <li>Pretty self-explanatory, don't you think?</li>
                <li>This mathematical operator counts the number of values emitted from the source observable.</li>
                <li>Returns an output observable as a number, which specifies the number of elements emitted by the
                    observable.</li>

                <li>Useful when we have an inner observable that can have multiple emissions, but we only want to
